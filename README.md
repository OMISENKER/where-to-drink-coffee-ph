This web project was inspired by [Where to Drink Coffee PH Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/525965338100498) where coffee lovers all over the Philippines ask and share cafe recommendations.

This project is not affiliated or sponsored by the said group and is just one of my side-projects.

Where To Drink Coffee PH web project allows people to recommend and search for coffee shops with extensive filters to find the best cafe based on their preferences.

Filters include:

- Location/s
- Operating hours
- Work/Study-friendly (Wifi and/or sockets)
- Private event availability
- and more...

I am still on the early stages of developing this, want to collaborate with me? Just send me a message!
